HScript library used by Psych Engine and Funkin Cocoa. This repository exists to make sure people can still easily build versions of Psych and Funkin Cocoa, pulled from SScript version 8.1.6. To install this in place of SScript, use `haxelib git SScript https://github.com/KirbyKid256/SScript-Psych`

If you're thinking of using this library for something other than Psych or Cocoa, don't. Just use [hscript-improved](https://github.com/FNF-CNE-Devs/hscript-improved) instead.
